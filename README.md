# MAM Forum+

This does not add any *additional* functionality that would not already exist, it merely modifies the design of the forum and rearranges some of the pre-existing features. Such an example is the search bar on the main forum view- you could already search but this particular enhancement just adds a way to do it quicker.

MAM Forum+ does not require [MAM+](https://github.com/gardenshade/mam-plus) to work, but I personally do recommend MAM+ to enhance the site experience. This project is heavily inspired by MAM+ and draws from a few lines of code within that project. A big big thanks to [GardenShade](https://github.com/gardenshade)

## Installation
The first step is installing a browser extension that allows userscripts. Userscripts are files that can be used alongside a website's existing files to run code that the site doesn't have. I use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) primarily because that's what MAM+ suggests.

## Development

``` sh
# Compile and watch
$ npm run dev

# Build script
$ npm run build

# Lint
$ npm run lint
```
